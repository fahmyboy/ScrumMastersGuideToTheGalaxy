Influencing is an indirect attempt to achieve a particular outcome by exerting subtle pressure or guidance; there can be a fine line between influencing and manipulation. A Scrum Master needs to be able to exert some influence over members of the Scrum team, to help them make choices that will allow them to grow, but should generally resist the temptation to manipulate others into taking specific actions. Doing so leaves the team weaker, not stronger, in the long-term. An effective Scrum Master also needs to be able to influence the organization. Political capitol is essential for being able to influence. It's also helpful to remember "a dead Scrum Master is a useless Scrum Master." To build political capitol, help others, listen to their concerns, and establish credibility.

Influencing can be achieved by body language, such as gazing a person you'd like to speak up for several seconds, or standing near someone you'd like to volunteer. Reflecting someone's word choices in your own speech, or mirroring their body language, can make the person more receptive to your message.
