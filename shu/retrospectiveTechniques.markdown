#Retrospective techniques

Retrospectives can have many different purposes though most fall into two areas:
* Reflect on one more topics and come up with concrete action items to carry forward
* Team Building and Reflection (Improve Team Dynamics)

Almost all retrospectives are held using Whiteboard and/or Flip Chart that teams place post item notes on to represent their issues or ideas.

Retrospectives should be held at all levels, from Feature Team to Product Team.

###Basic 3 Category
Continue, Stop, Start - team identify's items from the last sprint they want continue or stop doing. Then in 3rd category they identify things they want start doing in the next sprint. The names of columns are often changed up - like, dislike, start or cool, uncool, make cool. Glad, Mad and Sad is similar retro but slight different contexts.

###Starfish
Draw five legged starfish (sort like spokes of a wheel), in between each leg is category: Start, Stop, Less, More, Continue

###Sailboat (better yet Pirate Ship)
Here , to best of your ability, sketch out scene with a boat with sails (good stuff), anchor (things that slow you down), island paradise (goal), rocks (blockers). You have team place post-it notes of things that relate to each area.

###Timeline
	1 hour
Timeline bar of memorable events, significant times for individuals - something to help them have relative understanding of the progression
	Facts above & Feeling below the timeline
	Categories:  Communication, Tools/Techniques (Equipment), Stakeholder/Relationships
	Each category is given different color post it.
	Break into small groups to write out stickies (how long did I try)
	Walked through items and discussed
	OCT 2015:  Tried it with SM about their 9am meeting
	NEXT TIME:  We didn't get to actions/to-dos; we scheduled another 30 minutes and came up with more specifics like moving the 9am meeting time & shortening it.
