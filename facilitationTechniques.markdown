###Dot Voting
This a way to have group priortize or pick a topic from list of choices quickly.

1. Make a list on white board or large post-it tablet (could use excel or word or similar software if desperate)
2. Based on the number items, make a judgement call on how many dots (votes) each person gets, usually 3 or 4 if prioritzing. This allows people more freedom then just choosing one vote and reduces decision times.
3. Folks then place a dot using a marker next to each topic they are interested in or feel is important. A person can place all or multiple dots on one item if they choose.
4. Once all folks have placed dots, the topic with most dots is the top priority or winner. Priorty of other items then can judge based decreasing number dots each gets.

Uses:

1. Retrospective - have a team list out topics they would like to discuss and then use dot voting to choose which ones to tackle first in the retro
2. Product Backlog Refinement - Not probably used as final solution to priortizing a back log since value and other more important things should drive final descisions, but can be used help weed out low priorty items if got large backlog to look at.
3. Really any other meeting where got limited time and need to prioritize topics

### Casual Loop Diagrams (CLD)
Originally developed in 1950's to analyse complex systems, Casual Loop diagrams can help you sort out and find root cause in complex or simple problems. They are sort of like more structured mind-map. You basically start with the problem or peice the system your interested in the center of the diagram. You then add in things that affect that peice or each other, using combination of arrow and symbols to mark whether the effect (cause) is positive or negative. This then allows you to identify what you can change to effect the system.

The "Loop" part comes in becuase you may be able to spot positive, negative or balanced "feedback" loops in your system once you have it  mapped out.

The symbols used vary a little depending what you read.

Common Symbols:
* Positive Effect: + or no symbol
* Negative Effect: - or letter "o" for opposite
* Delay Marker: two slashes in the arrow means there is a delayed reaction
