# ScrumMastersGuideToTheGalaxy

Who we are and who are we writing this for
==========================================
We are a group scrum masters.

We have been Scrum masters for a little over a year.

We have learned a ton, but have a lot more to learn. We are writing this guide with different people in mind:

*Someone who is considering becoming a scrum master
*Some who has become a scrum masters
*Ourselves

This is a guide not a book
--------------------------
The idea is that we are going to guide you through the minimum set of ideas you need to know. We are going to make you aware o things but not nessessarialy explain the ideas to you.

Part 1 Getting to shu
---------------------
Frameworks
*Scrum
*Kanban
*XP



Part 2 Getting to ha
--------------------


Shu Ha Ri is a martial arts term for the progression of learning.
The beginner state 'shu' is characterized by memorization and reptition.
The master teaches, the student repeats exactly as they were taught.

The 'ha' state occurs when the student has mastered shu and begins to 
selectively relax some of the constraints they were taught.  Some 
experimentation, but mostly characterized by a much, much deeper understanding,
especially of the underlying 'why?' behind the rules.

The 'ri' state is transendence, in which the mastery is profound, and the
rules are not followed because they are rules, but the effect is achived
almost effortlessly because the student deeply, deeply understands the
situation and is able to synthesize and generate approriate responses, 
even responses that were never previously taught.
